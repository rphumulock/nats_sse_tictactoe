# Datastar Vendor Bundle

This directory contains an `npm` registry reference to Datastar to help beginners obtain a stable copy of the Datastar framework

For advanced users, feel free to remove the `npm` setup entirely and obtain [a bundled copy of Datastar with exactly what you need](https://data-star.dev/bundler)
